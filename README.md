# kiyo-stopwatch
This is a personal project that I created to practice JS.
It is a stop watch that changes it's style depending on your screen viewport size!
Go to the website on your desktop, tablet, or smartphone for a different digital experience on each device.

Use the START, STOP, and RESET buttons to use the stopwatch.

Currently, refreshing the page will cause your timer progress to be lost.

I plan to add a function to allow the user to track intervals of time while the stop watch continues to run.  

Feel free to use my project for your own learning and make it your own.
I will continue to update this website with more fun styling in the future and add new features.
If you have any ideas and would like to contribute feel free to submit a pull request!
