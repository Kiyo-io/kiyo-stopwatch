# kiyo-stopwatch
This is a personal project that I created to practice JS.
It is a stop watch that changes it's style depending on your screen viewport size!
Feeel free to use my project for your own learning and make it your own.
I will continue to update this website with more fun styling in the future and add new features.
If you have any ideas and would like to contribute feel free to submit a pull request!
